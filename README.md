The video for Steven Sloan's instruction on brushless hub motors is:

Please note that in order to run the configuration for max speed, your droid should NOT be on its wheels, then put it in drive, select drive speed 3 (left thumbstick click down twice) and then hold both triggers AND shoulder buttons all at the same time, touch your nose, stand on one leg, recite the alphabet backwards, then move the drive thumbstick in a complete circle several times.

Big thanks to Steven Sloan for all his hard work on this.
Hugs
